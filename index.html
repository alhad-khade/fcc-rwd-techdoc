          The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual
          model that characterises and standardises the communication functions
          of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its
          underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the
          interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard
          communication protocols. The model partitions a communication system
          into abstraction layers.
        </p>
        <p>
          A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.
          For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a
          network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it
          calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that constitute
          the contents of that path.
        </p>
        <p>
          The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at
          the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

          The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception
          of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical transmission
          medium. It converts the digital bits into electrical, radio, or
          optical signals. Layer specifications define characteristics such as
          voltage levels, the timing of voltage changes, physical data rates,
          maximum transmission distances, modulation scheme, channel access
          method and physical connectors. This includes the layout of pins,
          voltages, line impedance, cable specifications, signal timing and
          frequency for wireless devices. Bit rate control is done at the
          physical layer and may define transmission mode as simplex, half
          duplex, and full duplex. The components of a physical layer can be
          described in terms of a network topology. Physical layer
          specifications are included in the specifications for the ubiquitous
          Bluetooth, Ethernet, and USB standards. An example of a less
          well-known physical layer specification would be for the CAN standard.

        <p>
          The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between
          two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors
          that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to
          establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected
          devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.
          IEEE 802 divides the data link layer into two sublayers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong> Medium access control (MAC) layer</strong> – responsible
            for controlling how devices in a network gain access to a medium and
            permission to transmit data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Logical link control (LLC) layer</strong> – responsible for
            identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls
            error checking and frame synchronization.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The MAC and LLC layers of IEEE 802 networks such as 802.3 Ethernet,
          802.11 Wi-Fi, and 802.15.4 ZigBee operate at the data link layer. The
          Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer protocol that can
          operate over several different physical layers, such as synchronous
          and asynchronous serial lines. The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides
          high-speed local area networking over existing wires (power lines,
          phone lines and coaxial cables), includes a complete data link layer
          that provides both error correction and flow control by means of a
          selective-repeat sliding-window protocol. Security, specifically
          (authenticated) encryption, at this layer can be applied with MACSec.

        <header>Layer 3 Network Layer</header>
        <p>
          The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of
          transferring variable length data sequences (called packets) from one
          node to another connected in "different networks". A network is a
          medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has
          an address and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer
          messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the
          content of a message and the address of the destination node and
          letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the
          destination node, possibly routing it through intermediate nodes. If
          the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on
          the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement
          message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at
          one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the
          fragments at another node. It may, but does not need to, report
          delivery errors. Message delivery at the network layer is not
          necessarily guaranteed to be reliable; a network layer protocol may
          provide reliable message delivery, but it need not do so. A number of
          layer-management protocols, a function defined in the management
          annex, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include routing
          protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information and
          error, and network-layer address assignment. It is the function of the
          payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol
          that carries them.

          The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of
          transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a
          destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow
          control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some
          protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the
          transport layer can keep track of the segments and retransmit those
          that fail delivery. The transport layer also provides the
          acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next
          data if no errors occurred. The transport layer creates segments out
          of the message received from the application layer. Segmentation is
          the process of dividing a long message into smaller messages.

          The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between
          computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections
          between the local and remote application. It provides for full-duplex,
          half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes procedures for
          checkpointing, suspending, restarting, and terminating a session. In
          the OSI model, this layer is responsible for gracefully closing a
          session, which is handled in the Transmission Control Protocol at the
          transport layer in the Internet Protocol Suite. This layer is also
          responsible for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not
          usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is
          commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use
          remote procedure calls.

        <p>
          The presentation layer establishes context between application-layer
          entities, in which the application-layer entities may use different
          syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping
          between them. If a mapping is available, presentation protocol data
          units are encapsulated into session protocol data units and passed
          down the protocol stack.
        </p>

        <p>
          This layer provides independence from data representation by
          translating between application and network formats. The presentation
          layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. This
          layer formats data to be sent across a network. It is sometimes called
          the syntax layer. The presentation layer can include compression
          functions. The Presentation Layer negotiates the Transfer Syntax.
        </p>

        <p>
          The original presentation structure used the Basic Encoding Rules of
          Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), with capabilities such as
          converting an EBCDIC-coded text file to an ASCII-coded file, or
          serialization of objects and other data structures from and to XML.
          ASN.1 effectively makes an application protocol invariant with respect
          to syntax.

        <header>Layer 7 Application Layer</header>
        <p>
          The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which
          means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly
          with the software application. This layer interacts with software
          applications that implement a communicating component. Such
          application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model.
          Application-layer functions typically include identifying
          communication partners, determining resource availability, and
          synchronizing communication. When identifying communication partners,
          the application layer determines the identity and availability of
          communication partners for an application with data to transmit. The
          most important distinction in the application layer is the distinction
          between the application-entity and the application. For example, a
          reservation website might have two application-entities: one using
          HTTP to communicate with its users, and one for a remote database
          protocol to record reservations. Neither of these protocols have
          anything to do with reservations. That logic is in the application
          itself. The application layer has no means to determine the
          availability of resources in the network.
